## Our Tasks

We applied our understanding of third-party APIs to access data and functionality from the NASA and Google Custom Search APIs. The NASA API is for getting the latest Sols(Dates) on Mars. The Google Search API allows users to customize the look and feel of the search results.

## User Story 
 As a user, I can get updates on the latest weather on Mars through a customized search engine.
